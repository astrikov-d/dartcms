Bootstro.js
========
Tiny JS library taking advantage of bootstrap's popover to help guide your users around. <a href='http://clu3.github.com/bootstro.js'>Demo</a>

Latest update (2013/12/12)
========
Bootstro now supports bootstrap3. yay! No changes to code if you're using bootstrap 3. 1 line change if you still use bootstrap 2. Please have a look at the demo. Thanks a lot to <a href='https://github.com/clu3/bootstro.js/pull/42'>Netsstea pull request</a> to make this possible.

I removed bootstro.min.js from the repo for less trouble. Please minify bootstro yourself if you need to.


TODOs 
========

 - <a href='http://linkedin.github.io/hopscotch/'>hopscotch<a/> by linkedin is a good alternative. It supports multi-page slideshows by writing stuff to localStorage/cookie
 - Change documentation to encourage making slideshow data from a JS variable or via ajax, rather than injecting data-bootstro-* attributes into HTML. Currenty bootstro.js already supports both methods but the documentation/demo page makes it sound like users should inject slideshow data into HTML. This is not only making HTML dirty but also causes bugs like <a href='https://github.com/clu3/bootstro.js/pull/24'>this unmerged pull request</a>
 - Supports multi-page slideshows like hopscotch
 - Make this project a proper test-driven JS library, like test cases, automatically minifying stuff...
 
Please log issues/comments/pull requests.
