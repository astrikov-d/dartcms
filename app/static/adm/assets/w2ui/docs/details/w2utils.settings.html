    time_format       : "hh:mi pm",
    currencyPrefix    : "$",
    currencySuffix    : "",
    currencyPrecision : 2,
    groupSymbol       : ",",
    decimalSymbol     : ".",
    shortmonths       : ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"],
    fullmonths        : ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", 
                         "September", "October", "November", "December"],
    shortdays         : ["M", "T", "W", "T", "F", "S","S"],
    fulldays          : ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"],
    dataType          : 'HTTP',     // can be HTTP, RESTFULL, JSON (case sensative)
    phrases           : {}          // empty object for phrases
}
</textarea>

You can define and load settings based on your locale. See <a class="method" href="w2utils.locale">.locale()</a> method
for more information. All locale specific files are located in the /src/locale folder on github.com

The dataType setting has 3 possible options. Below is explanation what they mean:
<div style="height: 20px"></div>

HTTP - is the default one and will submit GET or POST where it makes more sense by the size of the data submitted in w2grid, w2form and in autocomplete field (enum and list)
<div style="height: 20px"></div>

RESTULL - will fully comply with REST standard and will submit GET or POST or PUT or DELETE actions where needed. Note that often PUT and DELETE are disabled by various hosting services.
<div style="height: 20px"></div>

JSON - will submit all variables as JSON payload (not HTTP POST). On the server it needs to be parse differently.
