Installation
------------

You need the virtualenv package to start. Also, of course you need to create the database and database user before you'll
run the installation script.

If you want to change the LESS sources, you'll need to install the NodeJS and Grunt.

Clone this repository to your local machine and rename conf/dev/project_settings_template.py
to /conf/dev/project_settings.py. This is the start point for your project - settings file. Tune it and run the
install/install.sh script. This script will install virtual environment for your project and all necessary dependencies
(see the install/dependencies.txt file).
